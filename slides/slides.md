# What struggles do you encounter in working with data and/or code in your daily work? (excerpt)

- _"Dependency management and conflicts. Cluttered global environment. Reproducibility issues"_
- _"When I want to use the code I used before, I can not find them. And everytime I want to install a new software, always take me lot of time, and make my previous software doesn't work."_
- _"docker containers being in the wrong architecture. (on a apple silicone mac) creating easy sharable dashboards for data visualization"_
- _"Managing diligently changes to my code, making meaningful comments to my commits and versioning the repos. Keeping really good notes of my methods, results, and justifications that lead to changes of methodology."_

---

# Which topics would you like to learn about in this workshop? (excerpt)
- _"I am curious about the tools mentioned and see how they are applied."_
- _"CI/CD and testing"_
- _"Git, Docker"_
- _"docker containers like the streamlit we did but maybe also for developing (devpod seems interesting)"_
- _"Things that docker can be used for that are maybe not so common"_

# Problem setting I
![bg right height:70%](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/stress-work-workplace-crisis-hard-600nw-2260047705.jpg)

"_It works on my machine_"
"_Do not touch this piece of code_"
"_This used to work_"
"_I have a backup on a USB drive_"
"_As long as it runs..._"
"_Warnings are not errors_"
"_It's just me who looks at this code anyways_"
"_Deployment is something that the IT people can look at_"

---

# Problem setting II

Tools such as Git, Conda and Docker are designed to make your life as a researcher, software developer and scientist easier. This benefit comes at the cost of added complexity and overhead in project planning. Your objective is to understand what role each tool plays, what they **should** be used for and also what they **shouldn't** be used for.

---

# Problem setting III

No tools in the world will save you from yourself. If you design a complex, undocumented, hard-to-maintain system, be aware of the risks this entails.

---

# Hard truths from research & industry
- __If there is no Git, it does not exist__: Few people - if any - in our domain will bother reimplementing your method. Some venues will require a well-documented repository.
Some frameworks are popular because they are easy to use and have good documentation.
- __Your public Git profile is like a modern business card__: Showcasing interesting, well-coded and well-documented projects eliminates potential discussions about your skillset.
- [No other technology is as widely used as Git](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-version-control-version-control-systems)
- Git commits serve as a proof of work and contribution.

---

# Git I
![bg right height:99%](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)
- Code versioning system, knowledge base, issue tracking, project management
- Work is organized in a __repository__
- A repository consists of one or more __branches__ (default: __main__ (master))
- Contributions are tracked in __commits__
- **Local** git repositories & **Remote** repositories

---

# Git II
![bg right height:80%](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control-ops-local-vs-remote.svg)
- Repositories are either **public** or **private**
- Code can be accessed using a __fork__ (independent copy) or a __clone__ (linked copy that keeps a reference to the target repository)
- __HTTPS__ or __SSH__ can be used to access repositories

---
# Git III : Rebasing vs. merging :gear:
- If you have strong opinions on this, [have at it!](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing)

---
# Pushing an existing folder
```bash
cd existing_folder
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin git@your.git.here:your_namespace/repo_name.git
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Initial commit"
```
---
# Pushing an existing git
```bash
cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin git@your.git.here:your_namespace/repo_name.git
```

---

# Gitfalls

- Working on the same file at the same time in the same branch
- Accidentally committing large files
- Liberal use of `--force`
- Pushes to the `main` branch
- Not writing tests
- Not using branches
- Not pulling frequently
- No project structure
- No `README.md`

---
# Regressions
- How do find the commit where a given feature last worked?
- `git checkout`?
- `git bisect`!
<!-- Inspired from https://stackoverflow.com/a/4714297 -->

---

# Binary search for the bad apple
```
git bisect start
git bisect bad # Current version is bad
git bisect good COMMIT_SHA # COMMIT_SHA is known to be good
```

---

# Project structures

- The folder structure of your project largely depends on your domain and toolstack
- _Keep seperate thing seperate_ (e.g. preprocessing and analysis)
- _Store configurations in a seperate folder, parse configs from this folder_
- _For configs, use readable formats like YAML or TOML_
- _Never type numbers_ (admittedly controversial, but there is some truth to this)
- _Keep logs of your experiments, do not just write to stdout_
- _"Modern" experiment tracking with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/experiment-tracking/)_

---
# Writing a helpful README :gear:
- What do you consider good examples of READMEs?
- What do you expect to find?
- What do you find difficult when writing a README?

---

# Completeness vs. brevity
1. Title and summary
2. Installation
3. Usage
4. Project structure (optional)
5. Testing
6. Contributing
7. License
8. Paper? Citation, acknowledgements

---

# Optional
- API documentation
- Roadmap or changelog
- FAQ / Troubleshooting
- Screenshots or demo GIFs

---

# Issue templates :gear:

- Store in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES`
- Different templates for different purposes, e.g. bug reports, regressions, feature requests, etc.
- Low effort templates attract low effort issues

___

# Git for project / research management

# Excursion: Code styles & linting :gear:

![bg left height:90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Henry_ford_1919.jpg/800px-Henry_ford_1919.jpg)

[Example](https://github.com/code-lukas/cologne-workshop/blob/main/code-conventions.md)

---

# Miscellaneous :gear:

- `git config --global alias.{ALIAS_NAME} ’{COMMAND}’`
- `git reset --hard @{u}`
- `git log --date=short --pretty=format:%ad | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head`
- `git log --author=”author_name”`
- The `checkout` operation used to be severely overloaded (branch creation, switch branch, get a certain version of a file…)
- Easier: use `switch` and `restore`
- `git stash`

---

# Frequently occurring files (hopefully) :gear:

- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `environment.yml`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `uv.lock`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `setup.py`
- `.gitignore`

---

# .gitignore :gear:

Files and directories listed in this file **will not be considered in commits**. Include build files, large files or config files that contain sensitive information.

Keep your repositories small & safe, put everything in there that does not need to be shared.

---

# Where should I store my keys then?

- Variables & Secrets
- GitHub recommendation: _If none of these options are possible, you can store authentication credentials in a .env file. Make sure to encrypt your .env file, and never push it to any repository.

# Menial work
![bg right height:50%](https://res.cloudinary.com/leaddev/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/dpr_auto/c_limit,w_1280,h_853/next/2024/07/Why-it-sucks-to-be-a-junior-developer-right-now-FINAL-1.png)

- Some tasks are always executed sequentially, e.g. make changes to a project, rebuild the project's docker image, push the image to a registry, deploy a container
- ... this gets repetitive really fast, for complex pipelines you might forget steps.

---

# Solution: CI/CD
<!-- ![bg right height:50%](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*4SdKiLaiybcISktsLmQTOg.png) -->
![bg right height:50%](./slides_static/ci2.png)
- __CI/CD__: Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
- Automate reocurring tasks using GitHub actions / GitLab pipelines, etc.
- Example use cases: application deployments, report generation

---

# CI/CD prerequisite: runners

_"Self-managed runners are GitLab Runner instances that you install, configure, and manage in your own infrastructure. You can install and register self-managed runners on all GitLab installations."_ - GitLab Docs

If your host system has an existing docker installation, you can use the offical gitlab runner image. This also means that you can have local, private runner on your device that handles tasks.

---

# Let's try this! :gear:
<!-- https://gitlab.com/personal5900739/CI-basics/ -->
```bash
docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart unless-stopped
  -v /Users/lh/Desktop/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
```
- If you are interested in trying this yourself and need assistance, let's talk during the hands-on!

---

![bg width:100%](./slides_static/ci_ui.png)

---

# Other :gear:
- Publicly available Git repositories are invaluable learning resources. Go to a famous repository and read their README, look at their project structure, read through their files, see how they code. What do they do differently? Why do they do it differently? What do you agree with? What are just opinions?
- Do not reinvent the wheel (unless you do it for learning purposes). GitHub is full of great projects that you can take inspiration from.
- Honorable mention: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x

---

<!-- # Wait ... where do I store my data?
- By default, Git is not designed to host and version large files.
- However, there are extensions such as [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com) that allow versioning of large files
- Ideally, you keep your data in a secure, centralized place such as an S3 bucket that allows you to flexibly access your data.

# Virtual environments

- Problem setting: You work in multiple projects that each have their own respective requirements, packages, dependencies and programming languages.
**How do you keep track?**

---

# Conda - package & environment manager

- Conda manages both different evironments **and** serves as a package manager
- **Why is it popular?**
Conda is able to resolve and bundle complex dependecies from non-python sources
- **What are the downsides?**
Conda's default dependency resolver is _slow_. Faster than installing dependencies manually, but slow enough to grind your gears. People were so frustrated that they reimplemented `conda` in C++: [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)

---
# 🐍 Conda Licensing Dispute (2024 - 2025)

### **Background**
- **Anaconda, Inc.** introduced new licensing and access terms for Conda repositories.  
- Commercial use of `repo.anaconda.com` now requires **paid enterprise subscriptions**.  
- Authentication barriers disrupted automated and CI/CD workflows.

---

# **Key points of dispute**
- **License shift:** From permissive open access → commercial restrictions.  
- **Community backlash:**  
  - Broke reproducibility in open research & education.  
  - Sparked debate over “open source” vs. “free to use.”  
- **Ecosystem response:**  
  - Growth of **Conda-Forge** and **Mamba** and as open alternatives.  
  - Push for fully FOSS dependency resolution and hosting.

---

# **Current status (late 2025)**
- Anaconda keeps commercial licensing for its channels.  
- **Conda-Forge** and **Mamba-Forge** act as de-facto open community hubs.  
- Ongoing debate: *sustainability vs. openness* in package infrastructure.

---

# Building your own package :gear:
- Example [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/medical_image_deidentification/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
- [Full overview](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

---

# Conda - getting started :gear:

Creating an environment with a specific python version
- `conda create -n myenv python=3.12`
You can install packages using `conda install ...`
- If you are on Apple Silicon you can alternatively use:
`conda create --platform osx-64 --name python-x64 python=3.12`
to produce an env native to x86_64

---

# Conda - a _fictional_ scenario
_You have a conference deadline approaching, you work all night to make it._
_The submission server is acting up. In a desperate attempt, you hunch over your mouse, send a prayer and spam the submit button. It finally goes through. You go to sleep._

_A few months later, you get reviews - mostly positive, but reviewer 2 wants you to conduct "a few more experiments". You open your project, rerun your code and ... alas, it doesn't work!_

**Where did you go wrong?**

---

# Conda - good practices

1. Do not reuse envs for multiple projects that have different requirements.
2. After submissions or stable versions run `conda env export > environment.yml`
3. If you work on multiple systems, this may not be enough `conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt`
**Limitation: operating system platform needs to be identical**
**Solution: use docker**

---

# Good practices continued :gear:

- After a submission or similar has been made, tag the current commit
`git tag mysubmission <COMMIT_ID>`
- Personal preference: keep a `submission` branch
```sh
mkdir -p ./submission/
conda env export > ./submission/submission_environment.yml
conda list --explicit > ./submission/submission_spec_file.txt
git tag SUBMISSION $(git rev-parse HEAD) 
```

---

# What if I didn't .. ? :gear:

- `conda list --revisions` and `conda install --revision <REVISION>` are your friends
- **Keep in mind that we are only talking about your code thus far!**
- But what about data?

---

# When do I commit, when do I backup my environment, when do I build a container?

- Depends on how much (or little) you trust yourself
- Two extremes: **Never** (please don't do this) *or* each commit triggers a CI/CD worfklow that builds a new Docker container, tags it with the `CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA` and pushes it to a registry

# Benefits of containerization

- Containers allow users to bring all dependencies (configs, packages and other dependencies) to a workflow
- Due to their isolated nature, they have several beneficial implications for security, reproducibility and maintainability – they also simplify deployments greatly
- They avoid invasive and time-consuming local installations

---

# Terminology

**Container**: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [What is a container?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/)

**Image**: A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container. [What is an image?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-an-image/)

**Registry**: An image registry is a centralized location for storing and sharing your container images. It can be either public or private. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use and is the default registry. [What is a registry?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-registry/)

# Let's try it out! :gear:

`docker run --rm -it ubuntu sh`

Congratulations, you are now running a fully fledged ubuntu on your host machine!

---

# Worfklow

`Dockerfile` -> `docker build . -t myimage` -> `docker run myimage`

---

# Basic commands :gear:
- `docker ps`: list all running containers
- `docker ps -a`: list all containers, including stopped ones
- `docker image ls`: list images
- `docker volume ls`: list volumes
- `docker pull <registry_name>/<image_name>:<tag>`: pull an image from a given registry
- `docker login`: login to Docker Hub
- `docker logs <container_name or container_id>`: get logs from a specific container
- `docker exec -it <container_name or container_id> <command>`: execute a command in a running container

---

# Housekeeping :gear:

- Docker stores build steps in layers to optimize build times and efficiency.

- `docker container rm <container_name or container_id>`
- `docker image rm <image_name or image_id>`
- `docker volume rm <volume_name or volume_id>`
- `docker container prune`, `-af`
- `docker image prune`, `-af`
- `docker volume prune`, `-af`
- `docker buildx prune`, `-af`
- `docker system prune`, `-af`

# One step at a time

- **How do I get data into my container?**
Application files should be copied into the container inside `Dockerfile` using the `COPY` keyword. For development purposes or access to files on the host system make use of `volumes`.

Example:
```yml
volumes:
    - "/directory/on/host/:/directory/in/container"
```
This definition can be extended using flags such as read-only (ro).
```yml
volumes:
    - "/directory/on/host/:/directory/in/container:ro"
```

---

# How do I set environment variables inside the container?

- `docker run -e SOME_VAR='some_value'`
- ```yml
  environment:
    SOME_VAR: 'some_value'
  ```

---

# I do not want to rebuild my containers all the time when i make changes to my code

- Use a seperate docker compose file to mount files at runtime:
```yml
services:
  slide-provider:
    volumes:
      - "./digitalpathology:/Volumes/digitalpathology"
  storage-viewer:
    volumes:
      - "./digitalpathology:/Volumes/digitalpathology"
```

- Chain your compose files:
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-develop.yml up`

---

# I cannot see my app in my browser

- Remember the port mapping for your service
```yml
  nginx:
    build: ./Viewer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:80"   # HOST:CONTAINER
    depends_on:
      - slide-provider
      - storage-viewer
    networks:
      - base_network
```

---

# I do not want to copy certain files

- Similar to a `.gitignore`, you can create a `.dockerignore` that will ignore files specified therein

---

# Reminders
- Keep an up-to-date list of requirements for your project!
`conda env export -f environment.yml` and `pip freeze > requirements.txt` are your friends
- Not sure which version is the latest? https://pypi.org/
- Know which runtimes and tools you require (Python, R, …)
- Set up your Docker container / development container when your project starts

---

# Docker alternatives
- Podman (no daemon, child processes)
- Apptainer (root installation, non-root execution)
- Many more

# Excursion: Devcontainers :gear:

Open the Git repository in VSCode -> Reopen in container.

# Cool Docker features :gear:
- Have you heard of LLMs?
```bash
docker desktop enable model-runner
docker desktop enable model-runner --tcp 12434
docker model pull ai/smollm2:360M-Q4_K_M
docker model run ai/smollm2:360M-Q4_K_M "Give me a fact about orcas."
```

---

# Usage in scripts :gear:
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:12434/engines/v1",
    model="ai/smollm2:360M-Q4_K_M",
    api_key="none"
)

response = llm.invoke("Give me a fact about orcas.")

print(response.content)
```
---
# `curl` alternative

```bash
curl http://localhost:12434/engines/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer none" \
  -d '{
    "model": "ai/smollm2:360M-Q4_K_M",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a fact about orcas."}
    ]
  }'
```

# If it runs locally you can ...
- use it on sensitive information
- **use it together with your local runner**
- **use it in local scripts**
- **use it in other workflows** such as n8n

0. (Optional) Form groups if you wish
1. Find a dataset (recommendations on the next slide)
2. Set up a Git repository for your project
3. Analyse the data, build a small visualization app in a docker container and push it to Docker Hub
4. Present one quick fact from your data that you find interesting and worth sharing

---
